# CrashForceCalculator

A very basic calculator to find the appropriate drop height to simulate the forces on a phone *mounted* in a sudden vehicle collision.

If loose, the forces could be multiples of what the calculator shows by default.

Why:
I was curious what kinds of forces a phone really sees, with the intent of better understanding how well secured it really needs to be, if it is going to be depended on as a life-safety device in the event of a collision.  In other words: Will it still be where you left it, or will it have grown wings and flown out the window, after hitting you in the face.

DISCLOSURE:
I know nothing about crash physics.  Take all of this with the biggest grain of salt you can manage.
