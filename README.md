# CrashForceCalculator
A very basic calculator to find the appropriate drop height to simulate the forces on a phone *mounted* in a sudden vehicle collision.  If loose, the forces could be multiples.  --DISCLOSURE-- I know nothing about crash physics.  Take all of this with the biggest grain of salt you can manage.
